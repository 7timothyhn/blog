Ever wondered what your pets think when you are not home? Or what do they think when you are doing things around the house? Well, me neither, but we can use our imagination, can't we? Welcome to my blog, where your pets' minds are interpreted to human speech, and their dangerous, heart-pumping, car-chasing, and sometimes lazy dreams and imaginations come to light. Each chapter will talk about a pet and their activity throughout the day or several days while adding a humorous twist. Sometimes, the animal might not be a pet. Sometimes it could be a wild animal outside the concrete jungle. It could be about a bear dreaming about tuna or a lion quietly approaching its prey. The goal is to make any viewer of this site laugh and have a good time and add their own pet's adventures to the site or the adventures of an animal; it is all up to the writer.
