Ever wondered what your pets think when you are not home? or what they think when you are doing things around the house? Well, me neither, but we can use our imagination, can't we? Welcome to my blog where your pets minds gets interpreted to human speech and where there dangerous, hearting pumping, car chasing and sometimes lazy dreams and imaginations comes to light. Each chapter will talk about a pet and there activity through the day or through several days while adding a humours twist. Sometimes, the animal might not be a pet. Sometimes it could be a wild animal outside the concreat jungle. It could be about a bear dreaming about tuna or a lion quietly approaching its pray. The goal is to make any veiwer of this site laugh and have a good time and maybe add their own pets adventures to the site or the advetures of an animal, it is all up to the writter.
