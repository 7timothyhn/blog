On todayâ€™s adventure, I will finally defeat the illusive noise machine. Humans call it cars. Yes, I am Rambo Indiana Jones the adventurer. Rediscoverer of lost new jewels, the uncoverer of hidden secrets. On today's adventure, I find the elusive bone of KFC. As with any adventure, I leave the base through the secret tunnel under the swinging wall, humans call it a gate. Now we sniff.

Sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff

Eureka, we found ascent, sniff, it seems to be a gold mind somewhere around here, sniff, and it seems to be an hour old. Quickly let us commence our search!

This is the most dangerous part of the job. My nemesis the noise machine always tries to kill me. If not for my amazing skills, they would have cut off my paw: I still have scars to this day. But I am the great Rambo the adventurer, I will never be caught. Vroom. Did you hear that? VROOOM. It's coming closer. VROOOM!! Run we must not be caught! We need the get ready to move. Ready, wait, and DODGE! Ha ha ha, it has misted now it is my turn! BARK BARK BARK. Few let me catch my breath. The noise machine is and always has been hard to catch and it creeps up on you and in a split second they try and hit you. when it passes, they just run away like the cowards they are. Absolutely pitiful. Now on to the treasure! Sniff sniff, huh? The scent of the treasure has been lost. CURESE YOU NOISE MACHINE!! Drats, now we have to regroup we have to make our way back to home base and recover our strength but next time the noise machine won't be that lucky and I will find give born of KFC.
