It has been years since I have conquered this domain. These servants have been doing well, but I still cannot understand why they keep standing on two legs. Are they always scared? Well, that is to be expected. Oh yes, it is very hard being me every morning when I wake up with my servants still lying in bed. How could they? Isn’t it that a proper servant should wake up before their master? Tsk tsk tsk, they are lucky I’m a forgiving master. But there is a perfect way to wake them up. First, you climb onto the bed, and then you sit on their face. They will smell my holy fragrance and jolt up with joy. Aren’t I amazing?

After the servants wake up, they feed me the most delicious treats they have; as they should. Every day they get to be graced by my presence.

This meal was as delicious as always; time for the morning pre-mid-morning nap.
Would you like to know when I found out I was a Princess? Well, I’m glad you asked the question. See, the servants; they feed me, pet me, give me water, and put me to sleep. Obviously, I am royalty, and they belong to serve. Who am I to prevent their happiness? Well, my day is over. It was a hectic day today; all the eating and sleeping, oh, it made me tired. Time to sleep and wake up tomorrow.
